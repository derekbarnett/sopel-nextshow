#            to the event you are using this to track.
#Valid options are:
# schedule = 1 - you are tracking specific weeks of the month
#                e.g. you are looking for something on the 1st and 3rd week every month
# schedule = 2 - you are tracking something so many weeks at a time
#                e.g. you want to track every other week, regardless of month
# a default of 1 is used simply because that was the original purpose of this plugin.
